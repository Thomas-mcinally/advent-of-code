- My first time writing code in C!
- Some inspo for C code: https://github.com/stevemolloy/AOC2023/tree/main
- Library for hashtable and dynamic arrays: https://github.com/stevemolloy/AOC2023/blob/68fadbce0cf4a735e20b371241571e95769a766b/day_08/src/stb_ds.h#L4
- Inspo for concise code (sols written in python): https://github.com/xHyroM/aoc/tree/main/2023



TODO, to make this project professional:
- Add tests
- Add github actions that build and test code
- Improved folder structure and refactor code to be professional
- Get feedback from experienced C developer
- Redo in C++ to see main differences?
